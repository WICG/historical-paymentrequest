      <p>
        This is a proposal for a new web API that will allow merchants (i.e. websites selling
        physical or digital goods) to easily accept payments from multiple payment methods with
        minimal integration.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
        This is very rought draft intended to begin discussion based on Zach Koch's explainer
        document [[EXPLAINER]]. This proposal attempts to align itself with the chartered scope
        of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Payments/WG/">Web Payment Working Group</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Buying things on the
        web, particularly on mobile, is a frustrating experience for users. Every website has its own flow
        and its own validation rules, and most require users to manually type in the same set of information
        over and over again. Likewise, it is difficult and time consuming for developers to create good
        checkout flows that support various payment schemes.</p>

        <p>We can fix this by allowing the User-Agent (e.g. browsers) to act as an intermediary between
        the three key parties in every transaction: The Merchant (e.g. an online web store), the
        Buyer (e.g. the user buying from the online web store), and the <a>Payment Method</a> (e.g.
        credit card, Bitcoin, Apple Pay). Information necessary to process and confirm a transaction
        is passed between the Payment Method and the Merchant via the User-Agent with the Buyer
        confirming and authing as necessary across the flow.</p>

        <p>In addition to better, more consistent user experiences, this also enables web sites to take
        advantage of more secure payment schemes (e.g. tokenization and system-level authentication)
        that are not possible with standard JavaScript libraries. This has the potential to reduce
        liability for the merchant and helps protect sensitive user information.</p>

        <p>This document describes an API for User Agents that forms part of the Payment Request
        system described in the Payment Request Architecture [[PAYMENTARCH]].</p>

      <section id="goals">

          <li>Standardize (to the extent that it makes sense) the communication flow between a
          merchant, user-agent, and <a>payment method</a></li>

      <p>
        A web page creates a <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> to make a payment request. This is
        is typically be associated with the user activating a "Buy", "Purchase", or "Checkout" button.
        The <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> allows the web page to exchange information with the
        user agent while the user is providing input before approving or denying a payment request.

      <p>The following example shows how to construct a <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> and begin the
